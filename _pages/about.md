I'm a Research Scientist at [Meta Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)]([https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/](https://ai.meta.com/research/)). My general research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and information retrieval.  I've worked on a variety of problems over the years, including information extraction, semantic role labeling, email spam filtering, keyword extraction and search & ad relevance.  My recent work focuses on continuous representations and neural network models, with applications in knowledge base embedding, semantic parsing and question answering.  More detail can be found in my publications page.  I also have presented conference tutorials and lectures on topics related to my research problems and projects.  Slides of these presentations can be found in my talks page.
Before joining FAIR, I was a Principal Research Scientist at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)](https://allenai.org).  Prior to that I was a Senior Researcher at [Microsoft Research (MSR)](http://research.microsoft.com).
